The relative frequencies of L1-L2, L1-L3/4 and L2-L3/4 transitions varied across genera, 101 families and genome types (Figures 3b-d, Table S2 ).
The odds of L1-L3/4 relative to L1-L2 (Table   112 S3, Figure S4 ).
There was no indication that L2 viruses tended to arise earlier in lineages than 113 L3/4 viruses.
Nor was there a consistent trend towards evolutionary recent (as measured by 114 relative node depth) increases in the number of viruses entering human populations.
We also 115 estimated the instantaneous transition rates between IT level (see Supplementary Materials).
116 The rates of L2-L3/4 transitions were not higher than the rates of L1-L3/4 transitions ( Figure   117 3g, Table S4 ).
This implies that the distributions of values of parameters a and c in our (Table S4) .In contrast to IT levels, host categories are not mutually exclusive traits of a virus 123 species/subtype, and for some genera (e.g. Ebolavirus) it is likely that we are missing sequences 124 from the reservoir host(s).
Therefore, we did not attempt a discrete traits analysis for host range 125 but compared the known non-human hosts for L2 and L3/4 viruses at the species/subtype and 126 genus levels (see Supplementary Materials).
At the species/subtype level human viruses also 127 found in non-human primates were most likely to be L3/4 rather than L2; those also found in 128 birds were least likely (Figure 4) .
At the genus level the pattern was similar (Spearman's rank 129 correlation of coefficient estimates by host category = +0.89, P<0.01) but the confidence In keeping with earlier work 15 , we used RNA-dependent RNA polymerase protein-based 136 phylogenies in our main analysis.
