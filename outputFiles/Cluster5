Integration, an obligate step in retrovirus replication, is defined as the covalent insertion of viral DNA into the host cell genome.
Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) proviruses appear to contribute to viral persistence.
This is most evident in treated patients, where the proviral load seems to be unaffected by combination antiretroviral therapy that clears viremia (10) .
To date, proviral DNA has proven impossible to eradicate without death of the transduced host cell.
These results suggest that provirus may serve as a treatment-resistant reservoir of HIV-1.
Quantitative studies of this reservoir are challenging because of the relative rarity of integration events in quiescent leukocytes.
Assays for HIV-1 integration have been implemented using three main strategies, namely, inverse PCR (7), linker-primer PCR (37) , and Alu PCR (2, 3, 5, 12, 34) .
We focus on and refine the latter method here.Alu elements are the most numerous repetitive elements in primate genomic DNA, comprising over 1 million copies per diploid cell (22, 26) , or 5% of the mass of the human genome.
They continue to accumulate, at a rate of about 1 insertion in every 200 live births (14) , via an RNA polymerase III-dependent process called retroposition.
Alu elements are randomly distributed, roughly 5,000 bp apart, and are randomly oriented.Early HIV-1 integration assays utilizing Alu repeat elements as "anchors" within genomic DNA were sensitive but were not strictly quantitative, since they lacked real-time reaction mon-itoring and polyclonal standards.
