The initial case of COVID-19 in Japan was that of a patient returning from Wuhan, China who showed symptoms on 3 January, 2020.
Subsequently, as of 11 March, 2020, 503 cases were announced, including asymptomatic or those abroad in countries such as China but excluding those infected on a large cruise ship, the Diamond Princess [1] .Sports and entertainment events were canceled in Japan for two weeks from 26 February to 11 March according to a government advisory.
At the same time, it was advised that small business and private meetings be cancelled voluntarily.
The policy is designated as voluntary event cancellation (VEC).
Moreover, since 3 March, almost all schools have been closed to control the spread until early April.
Although schoolchildren are not of pestiferous age, the policy effects remain unknown.
These policies must be evaluated as soon as possible.
If the effective reproduction number, R v under these measures is less than one, the outbreak can be contained.
Alternatively, even given a low R 0 before these measures, if it was greater than one, it might prolong the outbreak.
Nevertheless, one could expect to prevent some fatal cases over time by easing burdens on medical resources or developing a vaccine.
