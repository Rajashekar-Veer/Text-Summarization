Understanding the factors underpinning COVID-19 infection and mortality rates is essential in order to implement actions that help mitigate the current pandemic.
SARS-CoV-2 (the virus causing COVID-19 disease) might exhibit a preference for cool and dry conditions, like its SARS-CoV predecessor (Araujo & Naimi, 2020) .
For instance, recent analyses found an association between temperature and COVID-19 growth rates (Shi et al., 2020; Ficetola & Rubolini, 2020) , although another study reported no effect of climate on COVID-19 transmission rates (Luo et al., 2020) .
Detailed models assessing how climatic and socio-economic factors influence both infection and mortality rates based on sufficient cross-country exponential growth-phase data are nevertheless still lacking.Here we evaluate how a suit of 15 climate and socio-economic variables influence exponential growth-phase COVID-19 infection and mortality rates across countries with sufficient available data.
We hope these results help raise awareness of the dear consequences COVID-19 may impose on some low-income countries.Country-level data on COVID-19 confirmed number of cases and deaths was downloaded from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/ download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide), and included all records up to March 30 th 2020.
To assess COVID-19 growth rate (hereafter infection rate) and mortality rate, we excluded all records before a country reached a minimum threshold of 100 confirmed cases, as well as countries with less than 10 days of records and less than a total number of 1000 confirmed cases.
Additionally, we excluded post-exponential growth records in countries where we observed that growth curves were beginning to flatten (China, South_Korea, Iran, Italy, Spain, United States of America, and Austria; exclusion dates are shown in Script_S1).
These stringent filtering criteria ensured we had at least 10 continuous days with confirmed records during the exponential growth-phase, for countries that tested a minimum number of 1000 persons.We gathered country-level climate and socio-economic data using the countries Alpha-2 and Alpha-3 codes and their centroid coordinates (https://gist.github.com/tadast/8827699#file-countries_codes_and_coordinates-csv).
Climate data included mean monthly temperature, precipitation and water vapor pressure (calculated between January and March), and was extracted from WorldClim 10 Arc-minutes rasters (https://worldclim.org/data/worldclim21.html) using each country's centroid.
Socio-economic data included GDP per capita (current US$), electric power consumption (kWh per capita), Human Capital Index (HCI), total population, rural population (% of total population), population ages 0-14 (% of total population), population ages 65 and above (% of total population), imports of goods and services (current US$), international tourism (number of arrivals), and scientific and technical journal articles (number), downloaded from the World Bank (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator) and Domestic General Government Health Expenditure (GGHE-D)per Capita (US$), downloaded from the World Health Organization (https://apps.who.int/nha/database/).2 .
