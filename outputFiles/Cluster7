Influenza is a respiratory virus that causes substantial annual morbidity and mortality, including an estimated 200,000 hospitalizations and 30,000 deaths in the United States each year [1] .
Vaccines are available for prevention of influenza virus infections, but recent estimates have shown only moderate vaccine effectiveness (VE) [2, 3] .
Annual variation is common, in terms of the frequency and severity of infection as well as in VE.
As a result, further studies of influenza VE and transmission are needed with the goal of improving control.Prospective, longitudinal community-based studies have a broad range of applications in respiratory virus epidemiology.
These studies will be essential to better understand the extent of the pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-COV-2 and the full range of COVID-19 illness.
These studies also present unique opportunities to explore more in-depth questions about immune correlates of influenza vaccine failure as well as susceptibility to and transmission of infection.
Nevertheless, they are much more resource intensive than comparably sized studies using case-control designs [4] .Ensuring adequate and timely specimen collection across a large cohort is particularly important as the circulation of respiratory viruses varies greatly on both a seasonal and annual basis.
The minimum detectable effect size for preventive interventions in these studies is particularly sensitive to variations in the infection risk.
Sensitive methods of pathogen detection (e.g. RT-PCR) have improved identification of cases, but specimen collection methods that are timely and reduce the burden on study participants are needed to minimize the likelihood of incorrectly determining infection status [5] .There have been several feasibility and validation studies which have suggested that self-or parent-collected nasal swabs are both acceptable and result in quality specimens for identification of respiratory viruses [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] .
There are few studies, however, involving community-based participants collecting specimens in their own homes, outside of a study clinic setting [12] .
