The initial case of COVID-19 in Japan was that of a patient returning from Wuhan, China who showed symptoms on 3 January, 2020.
Subsequently, as of 11 March, 2020, 503 cases were announced, including asymptomatic or those abroad in countries such as China but excluding those infected on a large cruise ship, the Diamond Princess [1] .Sports and entertainment events were canceled in Japan for two weeks from 26 February to 11 March according to a government advisory.
At the same time, it was advised that small business and private meetings be cancelled voluntarily.
The policy is designated as voluntary event cancellation (VEC).
Moreover, since 3 March, almost all schools have been closed to control the spread until early April.
Although schoolchildren are not of pestiferous age, the policy effects remain unknown.
These policies must be evaluated as soon as possible.
If the effective reproduction number, R v under these measures is less than one, the outbreak can be contained.
Alternatively, even given a low R 0 before these measures, if it was greater than one, it might prolong the outbreak.
Nevertheless, one could expect to prevent some fatal cases over time by easing burdens on medical resources or developing a vaccine.

In late December 2019, a novel coronavirus was officially named as SARS-CoV-2 by World Health Organization(WHO) and identified as the pathogen causing outbreaks of SARS-like and MERS-like illness in Chinese city of Wuhan, which was a zoonotic disease.
As of March 13, 2020 , the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has been reported in many areas of the world, with more than 130,000 people infected [1] .
With an alarmingly human-to-human transmissibility, the reproductive number of SARS-CoV-2 has been computed to around 3.28 [2] .
According to the data in NGDC(National Genomics Data Center), at 15:00(GMT+8) on March 13, 2020, 482 genomic variations of SARS-CoV-2 has been reported, which has aroused widespread concern.The B cell epitope of viral surface protein can specifically bind to the host's B cell antigen receptor and induce the body to produce protective antibody and humoral immune response.
The discovery of epitopes is helpful to the development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and the understanding of SARS-CoV-2's pathogenesis [3] .
3 proteins embedded in the virus envelope of SARS-CoV-2 have been identified, Spike(S) protein, Envelope(E) protein, Membrane(M) protein.
At present, due to the lack of study of the crystal structure of surface protein of SARS-CoV-2, the study of epitopes is timeconsuming, power-consuming, cost and difficult [4] .In this work, we analyzed the surface protein of SARS-CoV-2, predicted the structures with bioinformatics methods.
On the basis, we predicted the linear and conformational B cell epitopes, analyzed the conservation of the epitopes, the adaptability and other evolutionary characteristics of the surface protein, which provided a theoretical basis for the vaccine development and prevention of SARS-CoV-2.the GMQE score of 0.73.
According to the evaluation of the structure by Ramachandran plot( Figure 1C ), 100% of the residues were located in the most favoured regions( Table   1 ), indicating that the structure was reliable.
The E protein of SARS-CoV-2 is a pentamer( Figure 1D ), which can be divided into the concentrated transmembrane part and the head located outside the envelope.

The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization, while several key epidemiological parameters of the disease remain to be clarified.
This study aimed to obtain robust estimates of the incubation period, upper limit of latent period (interval between infector's exposure and infectee's exposure), serial interval, time point of exposure (the day of infectee's exposure to infector relative to the latter's symptom onset date) and basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19.Between late February and early March of 2020, the individual data of laboratory confirmed cases of COVID-19 were retrieved from 10728 publicly available reports released by the health authorities of and outside China and from 1790 publications identified in PubMed and CNKI.To be eligible, a report had to contain the data that allowed for estimation of at least one parameter.
As relevant data mainly came from clustering cases, the clusters for which no evidence was available to establish transmission order were all excluded to ensure accuracy of estimates.
Additionally, only the cases with an exposure period spanning 3 days or less were included in the estimation of parameters involving exposure date, and a simple method for determining exposure date was adopted to ensure the error of estimates be small (< 0.3 day).Depending on specific parameters, three or four of normal, lognormal, Weibull, and gamma distributions were fitted to the datasets and the results from appropriate models were presented.In total, 1155 cases from China, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Vietnam, Germany and Malaysia were included for the final analysis.
The mean and standard deviation were 7.44 days and 4.39 days for incubation period, 2.52 days and 3.95 days for the upper limit of latent period, 6 .70 days and 5.20 days for serial interval, and -0.19 day (i.e., 0.19 day before infector's symptom onset) and 3.32 days for time point of exposure.
R0 was estimated to be 1.70 and 1.78 based on two different formulas.
For 39 (6.64%) cases, the incubation periods were longer than 14 days.
In 102 (43.78%) infector-infectee pairs, transmission occurred before infectors' symptom onsets.
In 27 (3.92%) infector-infectee pairs, infectees' symptom onsets occurred before those of infectors.
Stratified analysis showed that incubation period and serial interval were consistently longer for those with less severe disease and for those whose primary cases had less severe disease.

The relative frequencies of L1-L2, L1-L3/4 and L2-L3/4 transitions varied across genera, 101 families and genome types (Figures 3b-d, Table S2 ).
The odds of L1-L3/4 relative to L1-L2 (Table   112 S3, Figure S4 ).
There was no indication that L2 viruses tended to arise earlier in lineages than 113 L3/4 viruses.
Nor was there a consistent trend towards evolutionary recent (as measured by 114 relative node depth) increases in the number of viruses entering human populations.
We also 115 estimated the instantaneous transition rates between IT level (see Supplementary Materials).
116 The rates of L2-L3/4 transitions were not higher than the rates of L1-L3/4 transitions ( Figure   117 3g, Table S4 ).
This implies that the distributions of values of parameters a and c in our (Table S4) .In contrast to IT levels, host categories are not mutually exclusive traits of a virus 123 species/subtype, and for some genera (e.g. Ebolavirus) it is likely that we are missing sequences 124 from the reservoir host(s).
Therefore, we did not attempt a discrete traits analysis for host range 125 but compared the known non-human hosts for L2 and L3/4 viruses at the species/subtype and 126 genus levels (see Supplementary Materials).
At the species/subtype level human viruses also 127 found in non-human primates were most likely to be L3/4 rather than L2; those also found in 128 birds were least likely (Figure 4) .
At the genus level the pattern was similar (Spearman's rank 129 correlation of coefficient estimates by host category = +0.89, P<0.01) but the confidence In keeping with earlier work 15 , we used RNA-dependent RNA polymerase protein-based 136 phylogenies in our main analysis.

The outbreak of novel corona virus in the Wuhan city and its spread to other countries of the world has created a lot of stress and anxiety among the residents and health professionals around the globe.
Corona virus is an enveloped RNA virus.
There are four most common types of human corona viruses (229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1) which causes upper respiratory tract infections such as common cold [1] .
Some new strains of corona viruses like SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and a recently identified COVID-2019 virus evolved from corona viruses which are zoonotic in origin and these types can cause cataclysmic ailment in human being.
The Middle East respiratory syndrome corona virus (MERS-CoV) is transferred to human beings from the camels.
The civet cats are the source of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and from these infected cats; it is transmitted to human beings.
An outbreak of SARS-CoV has been reported from china in 2002-2003 and MERS-CoV has been identified in the patients with pneumonia in Middle East [2] [3] [4] .And now the recently identified novel coronavirus (COVID -2019) has been detected in the patients in the Wuhan city of China [5] .
The mode of transmission is person to person via respiratory droplets and median incubation period is four days [6] .
The disease in mild in majority of patients but in some cases severe to critical illness may occur which is characterized by breathing difficulty to respiratory failure.
The severity of disease is more associated with old age.

Integration, an obligate step in retrovirus replication, is defined as the covalent insertion of viral DNA into the host cell genome.
Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) proviruses appear to contribute to viral persistence.
This is most evident in treated patients, where the proviral load seems to be unaffected by combination antiretroviral therapy that clears viremia (10) .
To date, proviral DNA has proven impossible to eradicate without death of the transduced host cell.
These results suggest that provirus may serve as a treatment-resistant reservoir of HIV-1.
Quantitative studies of this reservoir are challenging because of the relative rarity of integration events in quiescent leukocytes.
Assays for HIV-1 integration have been implemented using three main strategies, namely, inverse PCR (7), linker-primer PCR (37) , and Alu PCR (2, 3, 5, 12, 34) .
We focus on and refine the latter method here.Alu elements are the most numerous repetitive elements in primate genomic DNA, comprising over 1 million copies per diploid cell (22, 26) , or 5% of the mass of the human genome.
They continue to accumulate, at a rate of about 1 insertion in every 200 live births (14) , via an RNA polymerase III-dependent process called retroposition.
Alu elements are randomly distributed, roughly 5,000 bp apart, and are randomly oriented.Early HIV-1 integration assays utilizing Alu repeat elements as "anchors" within genomic DNA were sensitive but were not strictly quantitative, since they lacked real-time reaction mon-itoring and polyclonal standards.

Rhinoviruses (RVs) are the largest related assemblage of genetically and antigenically distinct respiratory pathogens known, comprising 168 genotypes.
These picornavirus species often occur in symptomatic young children from community and hospital populations where they create a sizable burden for management and are a frequent trigger of wheeze.
[1] [2] [3] Picornavirus infections can more often be observed among children presenting to an emergency department than other respiratory virus infections.
4 Nearly three quarters of respiratory virus detection episodes during the first 28 days of life are due to RVs and over half are symptomatic.
3 Until recently, much of what is known of RV diversity, epidemiology and clinical impact was determined using human studies and cell culture methods in the 1950s to 1980s.
In 2006, the molecular discovery of a genetic clade of RVs that could only be cultured in vitro using sophisticated air-liquid interface cultures was subsequently ratified as a third species, Rhinovirus C (RV-C).
5, 6 To date, RV-C has added 56 distinct RV types to the genus Enterovirus, family Picornaviridae.
As more is learned, conclusions reached by some earlier studies have required re-examination and confirmation.
[5] [6] [7] We aimed to estimate the spectrum of RV genotypes, species seasonality and RV involvement in co-detections in Queensland using a convenience collection of airway sample extracts from patients with suspected respiratory infections, collected during 2001 and tested using molecular tools expected to account for all RV species.Specimens extracts (n=1179; 94% nasopharyngeal aspirates) for retrospective RV testing originated from an unselected sample of mostly young patients (57.5% male) aged one day to 90.1 years (average 5.4 years, median 1.5 years) from across Queensland who presented to a hospital or clinic serviced by Pathology Queensland, Queensland Health (PQ), with symptoms of acute respiratory infection during 2001.There was no systematic sampling protocol used, thus our sample did not represent .

Influenza is a respiratory virus that causes substantial annual morbidity and mortality, including an estimated 200,000 hospitalizations and 30,000 deaths in the United States each year [1] .
Vaccines are available for prevention of influenza virus infections, but recent estimates have shown only moderate vaccine effectiveness (VE) [2, 3] .
Annual variation is common, in terms of the frequency and severity of infection as well as in VE.
As a result, further studies of influenza VE and transmission are needed with the goal of improving control.Prospective, longitudinal community-based studies have a broad range of applications in respiratory virus epidemiology.
These studies will be essential to better understand the extent of the pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-COV-2 and the full range of COVID-19 illness.
These studies also present unique opportunities to explore more in-depth questions about immune correlates of influenza vaccine failure as well as susceptibility to and transmission of infection.
Nevertheless, they are much more resource intensive than comparably sized studies using case-control designs [4] .Ensuring adequate and timely specimen collection across a large cohort is particularly important as the circulation of respiratory viruses varies greatly on both a seasonal and annual basis.
The minimum detectable effect size for preventive interventions in these studies is particularly sensitive to variations in the infection risk.
Sensitive methods of pathogen detection (e.g. RT-PCR) have improved identification of cases, but specimen collection methods that are timely and reduce the burden on study participants are needed to minimize the likelihood of incorrectly determining infection status [5] .There have been several feasibility and validation studies which have suggested that self-or parent-collected nasal swabs are both acceptable and result in quality specimens for identification of respiratory viruses [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] .
There are few studies, however, involving community-based participants collecting specimens in their own homes, outside of a study clinic setting [12] .

Understanding the factors underpinning COVID-19 infection and mortality rates is essential in order to implement actions that help mitigate the current pandemic.
SARS-CoV-2 (the virus causing COVID-19 disease) might exhibit a preference for cool and dry conditions, like its SARS-CoV predecessor (Araujo & Naimi, 2020) .
For instance, recent analyses found an association between temperature and COVID-19 growth rates (Shi et al., 2020; Ficetola & Rubolini, 2020) , although another study reported no effect of climate on COVID-19 transmission rates (Luo et al., 2020) .
Detailed models assessing how climatic and socio-economic factors influence both infection and mortality rates based on sufficient cross-country exponential growth-phase data are nevertheless still lacking.Here we evaluate how a suit of 15 climate and socio-economic variables influence exponential growth-phase COVID-19 infection and mortality rates across countries with sufficient available data.
We hope these results help raise awareness of the dear consequences COVID-19 may impose on some low-income countries.Country-level data on COVID-19 confirmed number of cases and deaths was downloaded from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/ download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide), and included all records up to March 30 th 2020.
To assess COVID-19 growth rate (hereafter infection rate) and mortality rate, we excluded all records before a country reached a minimum threshold of 100 confirmed cases, as well as countries with less than 10 days of records and less than a total number of 1000 confirmed cases.
Additionally, we excluded post-exponential growth records in countries where we observed that growth curves were beginning to flatten (China, South_Korea, Iran, Italy, Spain, United States of America, and Austria; exclusion dates are shown in Script_S1).
These stringent filtering criteria ensured we had at least 10 continuous days with confirmed records during the exponential growth-phase, for countries that tested a minimum number of 1000 persons.We gathered country-level climate and socio-economic data using the countries Alpha-2 and Alpha-3 codes and their centroid coordinates (https://gist.github.com/tadast/8827699#file-countries_codes_and_coordinates-csv).
Climate data included mean monthly temperature, precipitation and water vapor pressure (calculated between January and March), and was extracted from WorldClim 10 Arc-minutes rasters (https://worldclim.org/data/worldclim21.html) using each country's centroid.
Socio-economic data included GDP per capita (current US$), electric power consumption (kWh per capita), Human Capital Index (HCI), total population, rural population (% of total population), population ages 0-14 (% of total population), population ages 65 and above (% of total population), imports of goods and services (current US$), international tourism (number of arrivals), and scientific and technical journal articles (number), downloaded from the World Bank (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator) and Domestic General Government Health Expenditure (GGHE-D)per Capita (US$), downloaded from the World Health Organization (https://apps.who.int/nha/database/).2 .

https://doi.org/10.1101/623678 doi: bioRxiv preprint sample was passed through a Sephadex G-25 column to remove the unencapsulated CF 188 via size exclusion chromatography.
The size of the LUVs was determined by DLS and the The leakage assay is a technique that permits the detection of changes in membrane 192 permeability.
It is based on the self-quenching ability of the fluorophore CF when it is highly 193 concentrated.
The CF was encapsulated within LUVs at enough concentration to be self-194 quenched and the LUVs were exposed to different concentrations of AgNPs. The ITO   211   slides were then assembled into an electroformation chamber each in contact with a copper   212   tape and separated by a Teflon gasket.
The chamber was filled with a 300 mM sucrose   213 solution (300 mOsm kg -1 ) and connected to a function generator to apply an AC electric field.The electroformation was carried out at 5 V peak to peak and 10 Hz for two hours and then FRAP experiments were performed on the top pole of GUVs before and after 20 ± 5 minutes 249 of exposure to AgNPs. A circular ROI of 5 ± 0.5 µm diameter was exposed to 5 bleaching 250 scans at 100% laser power and the recovery was monitored by recording time series of 100 251 frames with the confocal pinhole adjusted to 3 µm.
The recovery curves were fitted with 252 Origin Pro using the classic fluorescence recovery model 35, 36 : The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.
However, a small proportion of GUVs in HEPES saline experience a great change in membrane tension after exposure to 100 µM AgNPs which is also associated to a small decrease in bending rigidity (dashed box).
These GUVs show a membrane tension higher than 5x10 -7 Nm -1 and a bending rigidity between 10 and 15 κ b / k B T.The behaviour of nanomaterials in biological systems is governed by their The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.
We propose that single AgNPs do not possess enough energy to bend the membrane, 513 nonetheless the formation of NP clusters of a particular size and shape will increase their 514 ability to deform the membrane and produce invaginations and ILVs. The formation of these 515 structures removes excess membrane, which, along with the pressure generated by the 516 AgNPs that adhere onto the membrane, increases the membrane tension and can lead to 517 membrane poration 46 .
